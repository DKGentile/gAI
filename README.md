# gAI
Kotlin based Android application used to help you improve your greenthumb.
Using it is simple!
-Take a picture of your plant

-gAI analyzes your image
-gAI gives you a summary of the analysis
-gAI recommends ways to improve your plant's health, and recommends appropriate products (if needed)

I was able to accomplish this by using AWS Rekognition.
