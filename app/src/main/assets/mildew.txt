Alert: Your plant may be affected by mildew. A powdery or fuzzy white-gray coating is visible on the surface of leaves, stems, or buds, often starting as small circular patches. Infected areas may become distorted or stunted over time, and older leaves may yellow and drop prematurely. This condition typically thrives in environments with poor air circulation, high humidity, and moderate temperatures. Photosynthesis can be impaired if the mildew spreads extensively across foliage. Early detection and intervention are critical to preventing long-term damage.

To maintain your plantâ€™s health, increase air circulation around the plant by pruning dense foliage and ensuring adequate spacing. Water at the base of the plant to keep foliage dry, and avoid watering in the late evening. Remove and dispose of affected leaves using sterilized tools. If the issue persists, consider applying an appropriate fungicide labeled for mildew treatment. Maintaining consistent environmental conditions and routine inspection will help prevent future outbreaks.
