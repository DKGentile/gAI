Alert: Your plant may be showing signs of blight. Several leaves exhibit irregular discoloration, ranging from yellowing to dark brown or black spots, often with a water-soaked appearance. Affected areas may show rapid deterioration, with tissue becoming soft or brittle. Lesions may also be present on stems or fruit, potentially expanding over time. Wilting or sudden leaf drop can occur even when soil moisture is sufficient. Immediate assessment of humidity, air circulation, and potential pathogen presence is advised.

To help maintain your plantâ€™s health, remove any visibly infected material with sterilized tools and dispose of it away from other vegetation. Ensure the plant has adequate spacing for airflow and avoid overhead watering, especially in humid conditions. Use well-draining soil and avoid overwatering. If symptoms persist, consider applying an appropriate fungicide or consulting a local plant specialist for diagnostic testing. Regular monitoring and preventative care are key to minimizing the risk of disease recurrence.
